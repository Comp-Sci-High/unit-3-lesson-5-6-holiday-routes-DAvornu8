# Unit-3-Lesson-5-6---Holiday-Routes

This project includes a small interactive Valentine's Day mini-site in `public/interactive`.

How to run:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (if needed)
2. Start the server: `node index.js`
3. Start the server: `npm start` (server listens on port 4000 by default)

4. Open in browser: `http://localhost:4000/` 

If you're using a remote dev environment (Codespaces / Dev Container), make sure to forward port 4000 in the Ports/Forwarding view so you can open the URL from your host browser.

Features:
- Three pages: **Home**, **Date Night Ideas** (random sweet idea generator), and **Love Notes** (share notes + mini-quiz)
- CSS animations (falling hearts, heart pulse, confetti) with sparkles and a shifting pink background
- JavaScript interactivity: sweet suggestions, confetti & sparkle bursts, floating hearts, parallax decorative elements, and a short quiz

Have fun and Happy Valentine's Day! 💖
